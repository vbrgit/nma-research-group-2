abstract: We propose a novel stochastic algorithm that randomly samples entire rows
  and columns of the matrix as a way to approximate an arbitrary matrix function using
  the power series expansion. This contrasts with existing Monte Carlo methods, which
  only work with one entry at a time, resulting in a significantly better convergence
  rate than the original approach. To assess the applicability of our method, we compute
  the subgraph centrality and total communicability of several large networks. In
  all benchmarks analyzed so far, the performance of our method was significantly
  superior to the competition, being able to scale up to 64 CPU cores with remarkable
  efficiency. © The Author(s) 2024.
