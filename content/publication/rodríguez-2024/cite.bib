 abstract = {Neocaridina davidi, a small freshwater shrimp native to Asia, specifically China, Japan, Korea, and Vietnam, possesses remarkable resistance to poor water quality and offers various advantages over other invertebrate species to examine crucial issues in neuroscience and other related areas. These advantages include robustness, ease of maintenance, and transparency, making them useful for in vivo studies with optical imaging techniques. Despite its suitability for research purposes, particularly in the fields of imaging and fluorescent techniques, the lack of attention given to this species has resulted in the absence of a robust and replicable sedation protocol for immobilization and safe manipulation. Consequently, researchers face challenges in performing experimental procedures while minimizing harm to this specimen. In this study, we have developed and evaluated a simple sedation protocol specifically designed for Neocaridina davidi, assessing its effectiveness using light microscopy and image processing. © The Author(s) 2024.},
