abstract: Neocaridina davidi, a small freshwater shrimp native to Asia, specifically
  China, Japan, Korea, and Vietnam, possesses remarkable resistance to poor water
  quality and offers various advantages over other invertebrate species to examine
  crucial issues in neuroscience and other related areas. These advantages include
  robustness, ease of maintenance, and transparency, making them useful for in vivo
  studies with optical imaging techniques. Despite its suitability for research purposes,
  particularly in the fields of imaging and fluorescent techniques, the lack of attention
  given to this species has resulted in the absence of a robust and replicable sedation
  protocol for immobilization and safe manipulation. Consequently, researchers face
  challenges in performing experimental procedures while minimizing harm to this specimen.
  In this study, we have developed and evaluated a simple sedation protocol specifically
  designed for Neocaridina davidi, assessing its effectiveness using light microscopy
  and image processing. © The Author(s) 2024.
