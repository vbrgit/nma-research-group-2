abstract: We present a stochastic method for efficiently computing the solution of
  time-fractional partial differential equations (fPDEs) that model anomalous diffusion
  problems of the subdiffusive type. After discretizing the fPDE in space, the ensuing
  system of fractional linear equations is solved resorting to a Monte Carlo evaluation
  of the corresponding Mittag-Leffler matrix function. This is accomplished through
  the approximation of the expected value of a suitable multiplicative functional
  of a stochastic process, which consists of a Markov chain whose sojourn times in
  every state are Mittag-Leffler distributed. The resulting algorithm is able to calculate
  the solution at conveniently chosen points in the domain with high efficiency. In
  addition, we present how to generalize this algorithm in order to compute the complete
  solution. For several large-scale numerical problems, our method showed remarkable
  performance in both shared-memory and distributed-memory systems, achieving nearly
  perfect scalability up to 16,384 CPU cores. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd
