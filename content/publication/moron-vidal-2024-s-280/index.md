abstract: Probabilistic domain decomposition (PDD) is an alternative paradigm for
  solving boundary value problems (BVPs) in parallel with excellent scalability properties,
  thanks to its reliance on stochastic representations of the BVP. However, there
  are cases when the latter is less numerically convenient, or unknown. Semilinear
  elliptic BVPs and the Helmholtz equation are prominent examples of either class.
  In this paper, we overcome this issue by designing suitable iterative schemes for
  either problem. These schemes not only retain the desirable properties of PDD but
  also are optimally suited for pathwise variance reduction, resulting in a systematic,
  nearly cost-free reduction of the statistical error through the iterations. Numerical
  tests carried out on the supercomputer Marconi100 are presented. © 2024 Society
