abstract: This work analyzes different current source and conductivity parameterizations
  and their influence on the diurnal variation of the global electric circuit (GEC).
  The diurnal variations of the current source parameterizations obtained using electric
  field and conductivity measurements from plane overflights combined with global
  Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission satellite data give generally good agreement
  with measured diurnal variation of the electric field at Vostok, Antarctica, where
  reference experimental measurements are performed. An approach employing 85 GHz
  passive microwave observations to infer currents within the GEC is compared and
  shows the best agreement in amplitude and phase with experimental measurements.
  To study the conductivity influence, GEC models solving the continuity equation
  in 3-D are used to calculate atmospheric resistance using yearly averaged conductivity
  obtained from the global circulation model Community Earth System Model (CESM).
  Then, using current source parameterization combining mean currents and global counts
  of electrified clouds, if the exponential conductivity is substituted by the conductivity
  from CESM, the peak to peak diurnal variation of the ionospheric potential of the
  GEC decreases from 24% to 20%. The main reason for the change is the presence of
  clouds while effects of222 Rn ionization, aerosols, and topography are less pronounced.
  The simulated peak to peak diurnal variation of the electric field at Vostok is
  increased from 15% to 18% from the diurnal variation of the global current in the
  GEC if conductivity from CESM is used. © 2017. American Geophysical Union. All Rights
