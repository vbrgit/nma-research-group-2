abstract: 'A methodology is presented for the numerical solution of nonlinear elliptic
  systems in unbounded domains, consisting of three elements. First, the problem is
  posed on a finite domain by means of a proper nonlinear change of variables. The
  compressed domain is then discretised, regardless of its final shape, via the radial
  basis function partition of unity method. Finally, the system of nonlinear algebraic
  collocation equations is solved with the trust-region algorithm, taking advantage
  of analytically derived Jacobians. We validate the methodology on a benchmark of
  computational fluid mechanics: the steady viscous flow past a circular cylinder.
  The resulting flow characteristics compare very well with the literature. Then,
  we stress-test the methodology on less smooth obstacles—rounded and sharp square
  cylinders. As expected, in the latter scenario the solution is polluted by spurious
  oscillations, owing to the presence of boundary singularities. © 2024 The Author(s)'
