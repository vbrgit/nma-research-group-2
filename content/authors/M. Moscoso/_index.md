I am interested in research problems at the interface between mathematics, sciences, and engineering. I work on the development of mathematical methodologies and computational tools to extract information from complex data, specially when the data are scarce.  Mathematically, this includes compressed sensing tools, new optimization approaches, and data analysis. My applied research ranges from  the use of optimization methods in imaging, in particular in the development of data-driven algorithms, to other inverse problems that can benefit from the same or similar algorithms.
