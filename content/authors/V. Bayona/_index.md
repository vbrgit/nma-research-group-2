Víctor Bayona earned his PhD in Mathematical Engineering from Universidad Carlos III de Madrid in 2013. From 2013 to 2015, he was a Postdoctoral Fellow in the Advanced Study Program (ASP) at the [National Center for Atmospheric Research](https://ncar.ucar.edu/) in Boulder, Colorado, USA. He subsequently held research positions from 2015 to 2017 in the Numerical Aspects Section at the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts ([ECMWF](https://www.ecmwf.int/)) in Reading, UK, and the [Department of Mathematical Sciences](https://www.bath.ac.uk/departments/department-of-mathematical-sciences/) at the University of Bath, UK.

In 2017, Víctor Bayona joined the [Department of Mathematics](https://www.uc3m.es/departamento-matematicas/inicio) at Universidad Carlos III de Madrid as a Visiting Professor and has been serving as an Associate Professor since 2021. His research focuses on the development and application of numerical methods for partial differential equations (PDEs), with a particular emphasis on meshfree methods based on radial basis functions (RBFs).
