	abstract = {We present a stochastic method for efficiently computing the solution of time-fractional partial differential equations (fPDEs) that model anomalous diffusion problems of the subdiffusive type. After discretizing the fPDE in space, the ensuing system of fractional linear equations is solved resorting to a Monte Carlo evaluation of the corresponding Mittag-Leffler matrix function. This is accomplished through the approximation of the expected value of a suitable multiplicative functional of a stochastic process, which consists of a Markov chain whose sojourn times in every state are Mittag-Leffler distributed. The resulting algorithm is able to calculate the solution at conveniently chosen points in the domain with high efficiency. In addition, we present how to generalize this algorithm in order to compute the complete solution. For several large-scale numerical problems, our method showed remarkable performance in both shared-memory and distributed-memory systems, achieving nearly perfect scalability up to 16,384 CPU cores. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {In a recent paper [7], a hybrid supercomputing algorithm for elliptic equations has been proposed. The idea is that the interfacial nodal solutions solve a linear system, whose coefficients are expectations of functionals of stochastic differential equations confined within patches of about subdomain size. Compared to standard substructuring techniques, such as the Schur complement method for the skeleton, the hybrid approach produces an explicit and sparse shrunken matrix—hence suitable for substructuring again. The ultimate goal is to push strong scalability beyond the state of the art by leveraging the potential for parallelisation of stochastic calculus. Here, we present a major revamping of that framework, based on the insight of embedding the domain in a cover of overlapping circles (in two dimensions). This allows for efficient Fourier interpolation along the interfaces (now circumferences) and—crucially—for the evaluation of most of the interfacial system entries as the solution of small boundary value problems on a circle. This is both extremely efficient (as they can be solved in parallel and by the pseudospectral method) and free of Monte Carlo error. Stochastic numerics are only needed on the relatively few circles intersecting the domain boundary. In sum, the new formulation is significantly faster, simpler, and more accurate while retaining all of the advantageous properties of PDDSparse. Numerical experiments are included for the purpose of illustration. © 2024 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {Probabilistic domain decomposition (PDD) is an alternative paradigm for solving boundary value problems (BVPs) in parallel with excellent scalability properties, thanks to its reliance on stochastic representations of the BVP. However, there are cases when the latter is less numerically convenient, or unknown. Semilinear elliptic BVPs and the Helmholtz equation are prominent examples of either class. In this paper, we overcome this issue by designing suitable iterative schemes for either problem. These schemes not only retain the desirable properties of PDD but also are optimally suited for pathwise variance reduction, resulting in a systematic, nearly cost-free reduction of the statistical error through the iterations.

	abstract = {Within the framework of Game Theory, there are games where rewards depend on the relative rank between contenders rather than their absolute performance. We refer to these situations as contests. By relying on the formalism of Tullock success functions, we propose a model where two contenders fight in a contest on two fronts with different technology levels associated: a front with large resource demand and another with lower resource requirements. The parameter of the success function in each front determines the resource demand level. Furthermore, the redistribution or not of resources after a tie defines two different games. We solve the model analytically through the best-response map dynamics, finding a critical threshold for the ratio of the resources between contenders that determines the Nash Equilibrium basin and, consequently, the peace and fighting regimes. We also perform numerical simulations that corroborate and extend these findings. We hope this study will be of interest to areas as diverse as economic conflicts and geopolitics. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {A methodology is presented for the numerical solution of nonlinear elliptic systems in unbounded domains, consisting of three elements. First, the problem is posed on a finite domain by means of a proper nonlinear change of variables. The compressed domain is then discretised, regardless of its final shape, via the radial basis function partition of unity method. Finally, the system of nonlinear algebraic collocation equations is solved with the trust-region algorithm, taking advantage of analytically derived Jacobians. We validate the methodology on a benchmark of computational fluid mechanics: the steady viscous flow past a circular cylinder. The resulting flow characteristics compare very well with the literature. Then, we stress-test the methodology on less smooth obstacles—rounded and sharp square cylinders. As expected, in the latter scenario the solution is polluted by spurious oscillations, owing to the presence of boundary singularities. © 2024 The Author(s)},

Using a dictionary learning algorithm the first step estimates the true Green’s function vectors as columns in an unordered sensing matrix. The array data comes from many sparse sets of sources whose location and strength are not known to us. In the second step, the columns of the estimated sensing matrix are ordered for imaging using the multidimensional scaling algorithm with connectivity information derived from cross-correlations of its columns, as in time reversal. For these two steps to work together, we need data from large arrays of receivers so the columns of the sensing matrix are incoherent for the first step, as well as from sub-arrays so that they are coherent enough to obtain connectivity needed in the second step. Through simulation experiments, we show that the proposed method is able to provide images in complex media whose resolution is that of a homogeneous medium. Copyright © 2024 the Author(s).

	abstract = {Neocaridina davidi, a small freshwater shrimp native to Asia, specifically China, Japan, Korea, and Vietnam, possesses remarkable resistance to poor water quality and offers various advantages over other invertebrate species to examine crucial issues in neuroscience and other related areas. These advantages include robustness, ease of maintenance, and transparency, making them useful for in vivo studies with optical imaging techniques. Despite its suitability for research purposes, particularly in the fields of imaging and fluorescent techniques, the lack of attention given to this species has resulted in the absence of a robust and replicable sedation protocol for immobilization and safe manipulation. Consequently, researchers face challenges in performing experimental procedures while minimizing harm to this specimen. In this study, we have developed and evaluated a simple sedation protocol specifically designed for Neocaridina davidi, assessing its effectiveness using light microscopy and image processing. © The Author(s) 2024.},

	abstract = {The complex Helmholtz equation (Δ+k2)u=f (where k∈R,u(⋅),f(⋅)∈ℂ) is a mainstay of computational wave simulation. Despite its apparent simplicity, efficient numerical methods are challenging to design and, in some applications, regarded as an open problem. Two sources of difficulty are the large number of degrees of freedom and the indefiniteness of the matrices arising after discretisation. Seeking to meet them within the novel framework of probabilistic domain decomposition, we set out to rewrite the Helmholtz equation into a form amenable to the Feynman–Kac formula for elliptic boundary value problems. We consider two typical scenarios, the scattering of a plane wave and the propagation inside a cavity, and recast them as a sequence of Poisson equations. By means of stochastic arguments, we find a sufficient and simulatable condition for the convergence of the iterations. Upon discretisation a necessary condition for convergence can be derived by adding up the iterates using the harmonic series for the matrix inverse—we illustrate the procedure in the case of finite differences. From a practical point of view, our results are ultimately of limited scope. Nonetheless, the unexpected—even paradoxical—new direction of attack on the Helmholtz equation proposed by this work offers a fresh perspective on this classical and difficult problem. Our results show that there indeed exists a predictable range k<kmax in which this new ansatz works, with kmax being far below the challenging situation. © 2025 Elsevier B.V.},
